                </ul>
            <h4>Noodles</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 (3oz) packages of ramen noodles</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons chopped peanuts</li>
                    <li>2 medium green onions. Thinly sliced diagonally</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar, chili garlic sauce, and ginger together in a small bowl. Add peanut butter, whisking until well combined, and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a pot. Discard the flavor packet and add ramen noodles to the boiling water. Cook until noodles are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain noodles, reserving some of the noodle water in case you need to thin out the sauce later.</li>
                    <li>Pour sauce over ramen noodles, tossing until well coated. If sauce is too thick, thin out with a small amount of the reserved noodle water until you reach your desired consistency. Your hot noodles will soak up the sauce. Garnish with peanuts and green onion, and serve.</li>
                    <li>Wait to cool slightly before consuming. Enjoy!!!</li>
